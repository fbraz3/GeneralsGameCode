## Generals Game Code Build Project

This project provides **weekly builds** of the [GeneralsGameCode](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/) repository, aiming to help the community with up-to-date binaries and easier access to the latest changes.

- **Daily sync** with the upstream SuperHackers repository.
- **Weekly builds** including all recent updates.
- **Not an official project** from SuperHackers â€” community-driven and maintained.

## Motivation

Many users want to test the latest features and fixes from the GeneralsGameCode project without building from source. This project automates the process, delivering ready-to-use builds for everyone.

## How It Works

1. **Daily Sync:** The codebase is automatically synchronized with the upstream repository every day.
2. **Weekly Build:** Every week, a new build is generated with all the latest changes and made available here.

## Usage

- Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsGameCode/releases) section.
- Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to run the game.
