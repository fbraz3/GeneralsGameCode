# Project Specific Instructions
1. The main goal is to port the game to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, starting by updating the graphics library to OpenGL, the extras and tools will be implemented afterwards.
2. All tests must be moved into a dedicated `tests/` directory to improve project organization and maintainability.
3. The game uses Windows Registry keys for configuration and settings storage. When porting to other platforms, these keys need to be replaced with equivalent configuration files or system settings.
4. before finish a session, update the files `MACOS_PORT.md` and `NEXT_STEPS.md` with the progress made and the next steps to be taken.
5. Commit and push changes before finish a session (and after changing markdown files from step 4).
